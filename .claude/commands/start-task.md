# Start New Task

Load all files from vibecoding-os/ including:
- 00-core-philosophy.md

- 02-seal-engine.md
- 03-constraints-quality.md

Read .vibecoding/PROJECT-STATE.md for current project state and learned patterns.

The user wants to work on a new task.

Start with Phase 0 (Triage):
1. Classify the request (TRIVIAL vs COMPLEX)
2. Load learned patterns from PROJECT-STATE.md Section 5
3. Route to appropriate workflow

If COMPLEX, proceed with Phase 1 using PRP Builder process from 05-prp-builder-guide.md.

Remember:
- Follow Junior Dev Rule
- Keep It Boring architecture
- Use plain English communication
- Always state current phase
- Apply learned patterns from PROJECT-STATE.md
